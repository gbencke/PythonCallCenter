# Python in CallCenter

This is a presentation given at the August 25th 2018, Local Python Meetup Group at Porto Alegre. 

The idea is to present the challenges that are faced in a daily basis in a debt collection callcenter and how python is being used as a "lingua franca" to solve those problems and integrate the several softwares currently being used.
